# About this Project
We are trying to build a web-based P2P application to fulfill the sublet needs of Vanderbilt Students. Basically, students can sublet their apartments on the website and subtenants can contact the subletter. Our client is VUCSSA, Vanderbilt University Chinese Students and Scholars Association. Through our communication, we found out that sublets remained a pain point for a lot of international students, as all the leasing departments only do long-term leases and international students would waste money if they do not stay over the breaks. This website will facilitate posts by students to advertise their available apartment, allow other students to sort and view posts, and for them to message one another to set up the sublet. As we are limiting the users of this website to Vanderbilt students, users will be able to trust that everyone on the website has verified identities through Vanderbilt’s Single Sign On system.

# Framework
We’ll use the MERN tech stack which incorporates front end, back end, and database handling. MERN provides support for the technical needs of our web app, which includes database, web framework, front-end framework and web server. The most amazing feature of MERN is that the three-tier architecture uses only Javascript and JSON for communication. Therefore, the construction of a workflow between tiers would be easier in theory. What’s more, there are a lot of resources and community support for using MERN as our tech stack, which makes the learning process easier.
